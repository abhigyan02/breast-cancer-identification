# Breast-Cancer-Identification

This repository contains code that performs breast cancer classification using a decision tree classifier. The code utilizes the scikit-learn library for machine learning tasks and includes grid search to find the optimal hyperparameter for the decision tree classifier.

## Dataset

The breast cancer dataset used in this code is available in the scikit-learn library. It consists of 569 samples with 30 features each. These features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe various characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. The target variable indicates whether the breast mass is malignant (0) or benign (1).

# The script will perform the following steps:

- Load the breast cancer dataset.
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Perform grid search to find the best hyperparameter for the decision tree classifier.
- Fit the decision tree classifier on the training data using the best hyperparameter.
- Make predictions on the test set.
- Display the confusion matrix to evaluate the performance of the classifier.
- Print the accuracy of the classifier.
